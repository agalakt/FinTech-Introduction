# FinTech-Introduction
An introduction about me
My name is Alexander, and I have a background in Economics. For a career, I'd like to work in the investment domain as well as work with blockchain. However, I would prefer to work in a field or domain I achieve a talent for. I was interested in FinTech when I was studying in school because it was a topic that often came up.
